## Overview

This was the absolute perfect project to work on today.  I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine shot yesterday, and not only does my arm hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, I had some fever-like reactions last night during my sleep cycle.  At the same time it was freezing and blazing hot!  Man, last night sucked.

I say this was the perfect project to work on today, because today, 5/11 is the first day of my 30-day detox challenge, so some motivational quotes are the perfect thing I need to keep me focused on the goal, focused on getting past this vaccine shot, and focused on finding a new job!

I've been applying and applying with minimal-to-no response.  It's very frustrating and disheartening.  But I will NOT give up until I am a professional developer.  I will not give up!

PLEASE HIRE ME!

This was a very simple, 30 minute project.  I wasn't feeling very good because of the adverse vaccine reaction, but I still need to "fill those green boxes".  My goal has been for months at least one commit a day.  One new project a day.  Gotta show my dedication!  That being said, I am going to go lay down and relax the rest of the day now that I got my coding in for the day.

## Technologies Used

## About

Pretty simple project.  We make axios calls to a public API that serves motivational quotes.  After making the call, we display the result in the App.  The app features a really cool, animated button that let's the user collect a new quote.

It appears we are rate limited with this API.  pressing the button repeatedly does not issue an instant new quote.  There appears to be a roughly 5 second cooldown before you can get a new quote.
